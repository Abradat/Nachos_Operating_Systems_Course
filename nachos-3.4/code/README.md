Explaning Fork system call
The first thing we need is to initialize Fork in exception.cc because System call is a type of exception. First for testing we initialize Exit system call. then we made forker to implement Fork in it. In this implimentation we want to allocate same address space for child plus extra space for both child and father. For doint it we tried to write MemoreManager in addrspace.cc to find free pages.Ok now we copy the existing pages to our new page table then we try to find new pages. if it success we have that page in our new page table then we swap these tables. ok after allocating freespace for currentThread we need some changes in thread class for adding some paramethers to explain thread state.Then we create another thread and renew it's address space with his father. then we add thread to table of threads(join usage).Yield system call was easy and it only needed calling thread yield function. for testing we created fork.c class in test.
